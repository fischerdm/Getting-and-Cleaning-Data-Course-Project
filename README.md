# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo contains the relevant files of the course project for the „Getting and Cleaning Data“ course at Coursera. The course is part of the Data Science Specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins University.

The task of the project is to come up with a clean dataset. The raw data can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The repo contains a README.md file and the following other files:
* `CodeBook.md`
* `run_analysis.R`
* `Dataset_clean.txt`

`CodeBook.md` informs about the variables, the data and any transformations in order to clean up the dataset. `run_analysis.R` is the R script with all the commands to download, store and transform the raw dataset. `Dataset_clean.txt` is the output of the `run_analysis.R` file. It is the clean dataset and can be used for further analysis.
